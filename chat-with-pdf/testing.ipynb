Acoustic emission (AE) is \\r\\none of the most popular and widely studied methodologies employed for monitoring, due to its capabilities of \\r\\ndetecting, locating and capturing the evolution of damage. Most literature so far, has employed AE for char\\r\\nacterizing damage mechanisms and monitoring propagation, while only a few employ it for real time monitoring \\r\\nand even fewer for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prognosis. In the present work, we demonstrate a methodology \\r\\nfor leveraging AE recordings for prognostics of composite aerospace structures. Single stiffened CFRP panels are \\r\\nsubjected to a variety of compressive fatigue loadings, while AE sensors monitor the panels’ degradation in real \\r\\ntime. Several AE features, both from the time and frequency domains, are utilized to identify features capable of \\r\\ncapturing the degradation and used as Health Indicators for RUL prognosis. The choice of Health Indicators is \\r\\npredominantly made based on three prognostic attributes, i.e. monotonicity, trend and prognosability, which can \\r\\noverall affect the prognostic performance. RUL prediction of the panels is performed by employing two prom\\r\\ninent machine learning algorithms, i.e. Gaussian Process Regression and Artificial Neural Networks. It is evi\\r\\ndenced that the proposed AE-based methodology is highly capable to be utilized for RUL prediction of composite \\r\\nstructures under variable loading conditions. \\r\\n1. Introduction \\r\\nWith composite materials being used in increasingly more industries \\r\\nsuch as aeronautics and aerospace, it is important that their structural \\r\\nintegrity is ensured. Though these materials display high strength to \\r\\nweight ratios, as well as improved fatigue and corrosion resistance \\r\\ncompared to traditional metallic structures [1–3], their complex me\\r\\nchanical behavior, due to their anisotropic and inhomogeneous nature, \\r\\nmake them more difficult to comprehend and predict their performance \\r\\n[4,5]. During fatigue, the gradual degradation of the composites is \\r\\nlargely caused by the stiffness change and redistributions of stresses and \\r\\nstrains [6] and if combined with pre-existing or new damage, e.g. in the \\r\\nform of an impact, it further affects and complicates the materials’ \\r\\ndegradation. \\r\\nTo tackle such issues, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been \\r\\nintroduced as an extension of non-destructive testing [7]. SHM can be \\r\\ndefined as an automated method for determining adverse changes in the \\r\\nintegrity of mechanical systems utilizing permanently installed sensors. \\r\\nMethodologically, the main tasks of SHM come from the Prognostics and \\r\\nHealth Management discipline and consist of data acquisition, data \\r\\nprocessing, identification of degradation features/ health indicator \\r\\nconstruction, fault detection diagnostics and on the final level end-of-life \\r\\n(EoL) prognostics and decision making [8,9]. Real-time SHM technolo\\r\\ngies are essential in assessing the integrity of composites structures [10] \\r\\nproviding the ability to detect, locate, identify the type of damage and \\r\\nsometimes even quantify its extent. \\r\\nVarious SHM technologies for non-destructive evaluations are being \\r\\nstudied, with Acoustic Emission (AE) being among the most popular, \\r\\ndue to its capability to detect the progression of damage during the \\r\\ncomposite’s lifetime [11]. Generated signals from the various damage \\r\\nmechanisms can be captured by strategically placed AE sensors, \\r\\nproviding information on the degradation.

De Groot \\r\\net al. [15] used peak frequency to identify different damage mechanisms \\r\\nin composite laminates. Four main mechanisms were identified \\r\\nincluding matrix cracking, fiber/ matrix debonding, fiber pullout and \\r\\nfiber cracking. Gutkin et al. [16], also used frequency to distinguish the \\r\\ndifferent damage mechanisms in various different loadings, like tension, \\r\\ncompression and other. In [17] AE was used to monitor the compressive \\r\\nbehavior of composite coupons. Amplitude, duration and energy were \\r\\nused to identify the propagation of different damage mechanisms. De \\r\\nOliveira et al. [11] performed SHM on GFRP laminates using AE. Arti\\r\\nficial Neural Networks (ANN) were used to identify and classify the \\r\\ndifferent damage mechanisms. Liu et al. [18], used AE on composite \\r\\ncoupons with centrally located open-hole to monitor damage evolution \\r\\nand identify the failure mechanisms. Saeedifar et al. [19] studied the \\r\\neffect of Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID) in composite laminates \\r\\nusing AE. The evolution of the BVID was investigated by analyzing the \\r\\nAE signals from the different damage mechanisms using wavelet packet \\r\\ntransform. Broer et al. [20], used AE sensors to identify, locate and \\r\\nassess the severity of damage in single stiffened panels. The AE data \\r\\nwere also fused with strain data to provide improved diagnostics for the \\r\\nassessment of damage. \\r\\nThough there is extensive literature on diagnostics on composites \\r\\nutilizing AE, very few studies have focused on prognostics. Rajen\\r\\ndraboopathy et al. [21], performed tensile tests on GFRP specimens \\r\\naiming to eventually predict their maximum strength. A portion of the \\r\\nspecimens was used to train an ANN from AE data at various stages \\r\\nduring the test, while the remaining specimens were left to test the ca\\r\\npabilities of the ANN in predicting the failure load. In [22] impacted \\r\\ncomposite laminates were subjected to tensile tests. An ANN was trained \\r\\nusing AE data collected from different failure load percentages in order \\r\\nto predict the failure load of new specimens. The previous studies \\r\\nfocused only on predicting failure loads. Only few researches have \\r\\ntackled the task of predicting the RUL. Liu et al. [23], subjected com\\r\\nposite beams to fatigue loading and used AE to monitor the degradation. \\r\\nA normalized damage index is proposed as a feature to capture the \\r\\ndegradation. A Gaussian process (GP) model was then used to predict \\r\\nthe RUL of these composite beams. Eleftheroglou and Loutas [24] \\r\\nemployed AE to monitor open-hole CFRP coupon subjected to tensile \\r\\nfatigue. The rise-time to amplitude ratio (RA) was proposed as a Health \\r\\nIndicator to train a nonhomogeneous hidden semi Markov model \\r\\n(NHHSMM) to predict the RUL of the specimens. In [25] the NHHSMM \\r\\nwas compared with a Bayesian NN for the prediction of the RUL of open\\x02hole composite coupons. The NHHSMM displayed better performance \\r\\ncompared to the Bayesian NN, with was further solidified by the exis\\r\\ntence of prediction intervals. Eleftheroglou et al. in [26] fused AE data \\r\\nwith strain data from Digital image correlation (DIC) to monitor com\\r\\nposite coupons. The fused feature displayed higher monotonicity than \\r\\neach separate monitoring technique and provided improved RUL pre\\r\\ndictions. A modified Markov model was used for RUL predictions of \\r\\ncomposite coupons which had been subjected to tension fatigue. \\r\\nRecently in [27] an adaptive NHHSMM was developed for RUL predic\\r\\ntion of composite coupons. The adaptive model’s parameters are esti\\r\\nmated from diagnostic features derived from both the training and \\r\\ntesting data, and the model is able to adapt to the new training data. The \\r\\nmodel was trained with AE data collected from open-hole composite \\r\\ncoupons tested under tension fatigue, while for evaluating the meth\\r\\nodology, AE data collected from composite coupons subjected to fatigue \\r\\nloading with in-situ impacts; which are considered unseen events; were \\r\\nused. The model displayed high performance and was proven capable to \\r\\nadapt to the unexpected events. \\r\\nThe rather limited literature on prognostics of composite structures \\r\\nusing acoustic emission is mostly focused on coupon-level specimens \\r\\nunder constant loading and to the best of our knowledge no research is \\r\\navailable for more complex structures such as stiffened panels subjected \\r\\nto variable amplitude fatigue loading, as this involves more complex test \\r\\ncampaigns. In this paper, we use AE sensors to monitor the compression \\r\\nfatigue behavior of representative aeronautical panels, i.e., a composite \\r\\nsingle-stiffened panel, and propose a methodology to estimate the RUL \\r\\nFig. 1.

An initial damage is \\r\\nfirst introduced to the panels in the form of barely visible impact or \\r\\nartificial disbond, and AE is employed to monitor the panel under cyclic \\r\\nloading of different amplitudes. The experiments are also performed in \\r\\ndifferent locations and under different conditions further increasing the \\r\\ncomplexity of the prognostic task.

The collapse load, as averaged from 3 panels, \\r\\nwas determined at − 100kN and was used to guide the fatigue load \\r\\nselection. \\r\\n2.1. Experimental campaign \\r\\nTwo fatigue test campaigns were performed, one in the Delft Uni\\r\\nversity of Technology (faculty of Aerospace engineering) (TUD) and the \\r\\nother at the University of Patras (Department of Mechanical and Aero\\r\\nnautical engineering) (UPAT) consisting of constant amplitude \\r\\ncompression fatigue and variable amplitude compression fatigue \\r\\nrespectively. The fatigue parameters remained constant in both cam\\r\\npaigns with a load ratio of 10 and a frequency of 2 Hz. To allow for some \\r\\nadditional measurements, like strain measurements (DIC, FBG strain \\r\\nsensing) every 500 cycles quasi-static loadings were performed. These \\r\\nadditional data are not considered in the present research. \\r\\nFor the constant amplitude fatigue, the maximum fatigue load was \\r\\nset at 65% of the collapse load, namely 65kN (absolute value), while the \\r\\nvariable amplitude fatigue load started from 35% up to 65% of the \\r\\ncollapse load. The variable loading was applied in constant blocks and \\r\\nwas increased arbitrarily (usually by 5kN) after inspecting the extent of \\r\\nthe damage using a portable phased array camera [28]. \\r\\nAn initial damage is introduced before subjecting the stiffened panels \\r\\nto fatigue, either via a low-energy impact (to create BVID) or by a \\r\\nmanufacturing defect; in the form of an artificial disbond via a Teflon \\r\\ninsert; at the interface between the skin and the stiffener’s foot. The \\r\\nimpact damage is induced by drop-tower with an approximate energy of \\r\\n10 J and the goal was to create a damage at the skin/ stiffener interface \\r\\n(usually near the ¾ or ¼ of the panel length), similar to the disbond. \\r\\nHowever, due to the nature of the composite materials, the response to \\r\\nthe impact damage is not always the same, creating a wide range of \\r\\ndifferent damages, increasing the complexity of our task. More infor\\r\\nmation on the panels is provided in Table 1. \\r\\nAmong the other SHM systems, strategically placed AE sensors, are \\r\\nemployed to monitor the fatigue life of the SSPs. An AMSY-6 Vallen \\r\\nacquisition system is paired with four (4) Vallen VS900-M 100 − 900kHz \\r\\nbroadband sensors and an external pre-amplification of 34 dB was \\r\\nemployed to monitor the constant amplitude fatigue, while in the other \\r\\ncampaign; the variable amplitude in UPAT; two (2) Micro200HF \\r\\n500 − 4500kHz wideband sensors, with a Micro-II acquisition system, \\r\\nfrom Mistras Group, and an external pre-amplification with a gain of 40 \\r\\ndB were used. The different number of sensors is due to hardware lim\\r\\nitations. For consistency purposes, only the AE recordings from two out \\r\\nof the four sensors are considered in the upcoming study (constant \\r\\namplitude campaign only). The channels that were ignored were chosen \\r\\ndepending on the damage location, and channels located closer to the \\r\\ndamage were selected (vertical direction only). This was also the case for \\r\\npositioning the two AE sensors in the UPAT campaign (at the side of the \\r\\ndamage). The sensor positioning, with respect to the damage is shown in \\r\\nFig. 2. The sensors were clamped to the back side of the skin; where the \\r\\nstiffener is located; and a coupling agent was applied between the sensor \\r\\nand the skin. It should also be noted that sensor locations are side \\r\\ndependent, i.e., the y location is dependent on whether the sensors are \\r\\non the left or right side. Were the damage on the left side, the sensors to \\r\\nthe right are disregarded and the sensors and positions on the left side \\r\\nare used. \\r\\n2.2. Acoustic emission based health indicators \\r\\nFeatures capable of capturing the degradation of the structure are \\r\\nessential in data-driven prognostics. In the present research, we refer to \\r\\nsuch features as Health indicators (HIs). The HI’s quality plays a crucial \\r\\nrole, affecting the performance and accuracy of the prognostic algo\\r\\nrithms [29]. Some of the most sought attributes for an HI, in order to \\r\\nhave enhanced prognostic potential, are monotonicity and prognos\\r\\nability [30,31]. Monotonicity refers to the HI having an increasing or \\r\\ndecreasing behavior with damage/ time evolution. The most common \\r\\nmathematical expression for monotonicity is: \\r\\nMonotonicity = No.\\r\\ndF\\r\\ndt < 0 − No.\\r\\ndF\\r\\ndt ≥ 0\\r\\nn − 1 (1) \\r\\nwhere n the length of the HI time series and F an AE feature. \\r\\nPrognosability is a measure of variance in the EoL values of a pop\\r\\nulation of similar specimens. It is expressed by Eq. (2). Ffail and Fstart the \\r\\nvalues of feature F at the failure and starting time respectively. \\r\\nPrognosability = exp(− std(\\r\\nFfail)\\r\\nmean( ⃒\\r\\n⃒Fstart − Ffail\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n)\\r\\n)\\r\\n(2) \\r\\nFig. 3.

Trend is described \\r\\nin Eq. (3). Fispecj is the i\\r\\nth feature of specimen j and tspecj is the operational \\r\\ntime of specimen j. \\r\\nTrend(Fi) =\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n1\\r\\nN\\r\\n∑N\\r\\ni=1\\r\\ncorr(Fispecj, tspecj\\r\\n) ⃒\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n(3) \\r\\nAE provides an abundance of features as possible HI, such as the \\r\\nnumber of hits, hit amplitude, energy etc. The rise time to amplitude \\r\\nratio (RA) has also been employed as a prognostic feature [24]. Time \\r\\ndomain and frequency domain analysis can also provide new features for \\r\\nthe purpose of degradation monitoring. Some common features defined \\r\\nin the time and frequency domains can be found in Appendix A. In this \\r\\npaper we utilized 8 common AE features, namely amplitude, rise time, \\r\\nduration, counts to peak, RMS, energy, hits and RA as these are \\r\\ncommonly associated with degradation. Peak frequency, which is also \\r\\ncommonly associated with damage, were not recorded due to the limi\\r\\ntations of the acquisition systems (recording waveforms in real-time \\r\\nfatigue requires a lot of processing power). Inspired by [24], these fea\\r\\ntures are windowed so as to reveal a possibly hidden degradation trend. \\r\\nAfter some experimentation, a 500-cycle window was proven appro\\r\\npriate. Though windowing, especially for this many features and data, \\r\\ncan be a bit intensive, for the training data it can be done offline and \\r\\nhence not affect the applicability of the methodology in real-time. On \\r\\nthe other hand, new data can be processed as soon as each time window \\r\\nbecome available and only the required features can be calculated. \\r\\nBy discarding features whose change in consecutive time windows is \\r\\nFig. 4.

The sum of average monotonicity, prognosability and trend was \\r\\nmeasured as a quantitative metric to evaluate possible prognostic fea\\r\\ntures. The selected features and the value of the summed attributes are \\r\\nshown in Fig. 3. Visual inspection of these features was also performed \\r\\nto validate the results of the feature selection. The three top-ranked \\r\\nfeatures not selected through visual inspection, i.e. amplitude median, \\r\\namplitude mean and amplitude RMS, had high monotonicity (due to \\r\\nmany constant values), though trend and prognosability were lacking, \\r\\nand hence were not considered further. For this reason, the automatic \\r\\nselection procedure should be carefully set up, to avoid such setbacks. \\r\\nAs can be seen in Fig. 4a (also see Appendix B), the developed HIs are \\r\\nrather noisy throughout the test. To smoothen them and enhance the \\r\\nunderline trend as well as reduce the training time of the prognostic \\r\\nalgorithms in the next step, a 5000 cycle sliding moving average window \\r\\nwith no overlap data reduction is applied. The values of the features are \\r\\naveraged in these 5000 cycles windows and they are assigned time \\r\\nvalues of x*5000 cycles, where x is the increasing window number. \\r\\nFig. 4b depicts the smoothed windowed feature. It is evident that the \\r\\noverall trend of the HI remains similar and at the same time, the noise \\r\\nand volatile trend are reduced, providing a more monotonic HI, while \\r\\nthe overall attributes have also been improved (Fig. 4c). \\r\\nData collected from multiple sensors have different range of values. \\r\\nTo address the heterogeneity of the input data, it is important to \\r\\nnormalize them to a similar range. A normalization to the range [0,1] is \\r\\nperformed using Eq. (4) before employing them to train the ML algo\\r\\nrithms. No prior failure threshold is needed to be set with the regression \\r\\napproach that we follow and the normalization parameters of the \\r\\ntraining set are used to normalize the test set as well. \\r\\nF = Fi − min(Fi)\\r\\nmax(Fi) − min(Fi) (4) \\r\\n3. Machine learning algorithms for prognostics \\r\\nSeveral machine learning algorithms may be utilized for addressing \\r\\nthe challenging task of RUL prognosis. In this study two commonly used \\r\\nregression algorithms from the literature are employed to take on this \\r\\nchallenge. Gaussian process regression is selected for its ability to model \\r\\ncomplex trends with the use of the kernel function while also providing a \\r\\ndistribution for the RUL, while Artificial Neural Networks were \\r\\npreferred because they can easily model non-linear behaviors. \\r\\n3.1. Gaussian processes for regression (GPR) \\r\\nGaussian processes have been widely employed for RUL prognosis of \\r\\na variety of systems [33–36] and structures [23,37,38]. A GPs is a \\r\\ncollection of random variables with a joint Gaussian distribution, and \\r\\nare a function of f(x) at x = [x1, x2, …, xn]\\r\\nT. GP can be completely \\r\\nspecified [39] by its mean function: \\r\\nm(x) = E[f(x)] (5) \\r\\nAnd its covariance function: \\r\\nk(x, x\\r\\n′\\r\\n) = E[(f(x) − m(x))(f(x\\r\\n′\\r\\n) − m(x\\r\\n′\\r\\n))] (6) \\r\\nThen the GP can be written as: \\r\\nf(x) ∼ GP(m(x), k(x, x’\\r\\n)) (7) \\r\\nThe mean function m(x) is usually set to be zero. In our case though \\r\\nwe selected a linear function to characterize the mean (see Section 4). As \\r\\nit is noted in [39] different covariance functions yield different regres\\r\\nsion results, so this function should be considered carefully depending \\r\\non the data. \\r\\nAssuming a degradation history H = [xi, yi\\r\\n]N\\r\\ni=1, where xi the input \\r\\nvariables and yi = f(xi) +εi the noisy target variables, with εi is an i.i. \\r\\nd with 0 mean and σ2\\r\\nn(εi ∼ i.i.d N(0, σ2n)) the joint distribution of \\r\\nobserved target values y = [yi\\r\\n]N\\r\\ni=1 and unobserved target values f * at \\r\\nnew input locations x* can be denoted as: \\r\\n[ y\\r\\nf *\\r\\n]\\r\\n∼ N\\r\\n⎛\\r\\n⎝0,\\r\\n⎡\\r\\n⎣\\r\\nK(x, x) + σ2\\r\\nnI K(x, x*\\r\\n)\\r\\nK(x*\\r\\n, x) K(x*, x*)\\r\\n⎤\\r\\n⎦\\r\\n⎞\\r\\n⎠ (8) \\r\\nwhere I the identity matrix and K a matrix of all the covariance pairs \\r\\nk\\r\\n(\\r\\nxi, xj\\r\\n)\\r\\n.\\r\\nThe predictive (posterior) distribution for GPR, given the new inputs \\r\\nx*, the historic input data x and targets y is defined by: \\r\\np(f *\\r\\n|x, y,x*) ∼ N(f *, cov(f *)) (9) \\r\\nf\\r\\n* = E[f *\\r\\n|x, y,x*] = K(x*, x)\\r\\n[\\r\\nK(x, x) + σ2\\r\\nnI\\r\\n]− 1\\r\\ny, (10) \\r\\ncov(f *\\r\\n) = K(x*, x*)− K(x*, x)\\r\\n[\\r\\nK(x, x) + σ2\\r\\nnI\\r\\n]− 1\\r\\nK(x, x*) (11) \\r\\n3.2.

They are capable of modeling \\r\\nnon-linearities in addition to linear correlations between the input and \\r\\ntarget data. The general equation governing these types of models at an \\r\\ni\\r\\nth time point is: \\r\\nti = y(xi) + εi = f(xi,w) + εi (12) \\r\\nwhere y(xi) is the real regression mean and εi a noise term modeled as an \\r\\ni.i.d. with zero mean. The function f(xi,w) is used to correlate the input \\r\\nxi with the regression output y(xi) given a set of parameters w. \\r\\nThe main disadvantage of ANNs is their inability to incorporate \\r\\nuncertainty in their predictions. To this end, bootstrapping is applied to \\r\\ntackle this shortcoming. Bootstrapping is an algorithmic method for \\r\\nconstructing confidence and prediction intervals using the outputs of \\r\\nmultiple Neural Networks. This technique is used to approximate a \\r\\nstatistical distribution of the error term [40]. The idea behind boot\\r\\nstrapping is that given a dataset D, K ANNs are randomly initialized and \\r\\ndataset D is split into K training sets by resampling with replacement. If a \\r\\nsufficiently large enough K is selected (K > 100) then it can be assumed \\r\\nthat the predictions follow a normal distribution [41–43]. The mean and \\r\\nvariance of the predictions can be calculated as: \\r\\nypmean(xi) = 1\\r\\nK\\r\\n∑K\\r\\nk=1\\r\\nyk\\r\\np(xi) (13) \\r\\nσ2\\r\\nyp\\r\\n(xi) = 1\\r\\nK − 1\\r\\n∑K\\r\\nk=1\\r\\n(\\r\\nypmean (xi) − yk\\r\\np(xi)\\r\\n)2\\r\\n(14) \\r\\nwhere yk\\r\\np(xi) is the estimate of the kth NN for the true value y(xi) as \\r\\nestimated by f(xi, w). A schematic representation of the bootstrap \\r\\nmethodology for ANN can be seen in Fig. 5. \\r\\nOnce the mean and the variance of the ANN are calculated, the \\r\\nconfidence interval at every point xi can be constructed for the (1 − a)% \\r\\nconfidence level as: \\r\\nCI(xi) = ypmean (xi) ± t1− a\\r\\n2\\r\\n̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅\\r\\nσ2\\r\\nyp (xi)\\r\\n√\\r\\n(15) \\r\\n4. Results and discussion \\r\\nDue to the complexity of the loading conditions as well as the noise \\r\\nfrom the hydraulic machine, AE produces millions of hits with no \\r\\nevident degradation information at a first glance. Significant data pre\\x02processing steps are required in order to separate the useful degrada\\r\\ntion information from the external and internal noise. The first step is to \\r\\nfilter the constant noise produced by the hydraulic machine. An \\r\\namplitude threshold is set at a high 65 db in order to exclude AE hits \\r\\nrelated to noise from the machine which can contaminate and mask \\r\\ndegradation information. At the second stage, hits recorded during low \\r\\nload (due to some extra SHM measurements made) are discarded. Some \\r\\nextra post-processing is applied (study RA, energy, duration) to try and \\r\\nseparate degradation hits from other events captured during the cyclic \\r\\nloading, such as sensor cables touching the panels. Fig. 6 shows the \\r\\nretained hits for a representative panel. \\r\\nOut of the 13 SSPs tested in this research, 3 are randomly chosen as \\r\\nthe test set for evaluating the proposed methodology. The rest of the \\r\\nSSPs (10 SSPs) are used to learn the machine learning model parameters. \\r\\nThe two main tunable parameters of the GPR are the mean and \\r\\ncovariance functions. Due to the nature of the output, a linear mean \\r\\nfunction is used as shown in Eq. (16). For the covariance function, a \\r\\nMatern class kernel (Matern 5/2) is selected since it was found to fit the \\r\\ndata better (Eq. (17)). r is the Euclidean distance between two points xi,\\r\\nxj.

This layer combi\\r\\nnation is chosen by trial and error and no extensive investigation of \\r\\noptimal configuration is performed. The activation function in the two \\r\\nhidden layers is a sigmoid function while in the output layer a linear \\r\\nactivation function is applied. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is \\r\\nused to train the networks and each network uses 80% of the available \\r\\ndata for the training process to prevent overfitting. For the bootstrap, K \\r\\nis set to 200 ANNs. The training time for all 200 Networks was 320 s, \\r\\nwhile for the GPR model only 6 s. \\r\\nFig. 7 depicts the RUL prediction results accompanied by their 95% \\r\\nConfidence intervals. We can qualitatively say that for SSP 01 the pre\\r\\ndictions using GPR are always close to the true RUL, though at the EoL it \\r\\ndoes not manage to converge satisfactorily to the ground truth. Unlike \\r\\nSSP 01, the GPR model for SSP 06 shows overall better RUL estimations. \\r\\nThough at the beginning the predictions are not closing into the true \\r\\nRUL, after 50% of the lifetime they start converging to the truth. For \\r\\nspecimen SSP 07, up until approximately 75% of the lifetime, the pre\\r\\ndicted RUL is rather volatile, and does not have a clear trend.

Unlike the GPR after 75% of the lifetime, the BNN’s \\r\\npredictions approach the true RUL with a very good approximation, \\r\\nespecially near the EoL. What is worth highlighting is that the points of \\r\\nload changes the trend of the predicted RUL tends to change. This is \\r\\nmostly visible in SSP 06 at the early stages and at SSP 07 at both the early \\r\\nand the middle stages. \\r\\nTo demonstrate the need for the multivariate approach, i.e. using 10 \\r\\nfeatures instead of 1 to estimate the RUL, we compare the RUL estima\\r\\ntions of the multivariate approach with the predictions of the best \\r\\nfeature in terms of prognostic attributes, i.e. spectral skewness of hits. It \\r\\ncan be observed (Fig. 8) that the single feature-based predictions display \\r\\na more smooth and less volatile (fewer spikes) behavior compared to the \\r\\nmultivariate one, which is a result of the higher overall monotonicity of \\r\\nthis particular feature. However, it is evident that the EoL of two out of \\r\\nthe three panels is not predicted accurately, which can be attributed to \\r\\noverall lower prognosability. Only for SSP 06 we observed very good \\r\\nRUL estimations, though the multivariate approach’s estimations are \\r\\nstill superior. \\r\\nTo quantify the prediction performance, some common prognostic \\r\\nmetrics are employed such as the MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MAPE \\r\\n(Mean Absolute Prediction Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) \\r\\n[44]. Their formulations are presented in eq. (18)-(20) respectively: \\r\\nMAE = 1\\r\\nN\\r\\n∑N\\r\\ni=1\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒RULi − RUL*\\r\\ni\\r\\n⃒\\r\\n⃒ (18) \\r\\nMAPE = 1\\r\\nN\\r\\n∑N\\r\\ni− 1\\r\\n|RULi − RUL*\\r\\ni |\\r\\nRULi\\r\\n× 100 (19) \\r\\nRMSE =\\r\\n̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅\\r\\n∑N\\r\\ni=1\\r\\n(\\r\\nRULi − RUL*\\r\\ni\\r\\n)2\\r\\nN\\r\\n√√√√√ (20) \\r\\nRULi is the actual RUL and RUL*\\r\\ni is the predicted RUL at time t = i. \\r\\nTable 2 summarizes the aforementioned metrics for the different RUL \\r\\nestimation methodologies The metrics are calculated at both 50% and \\r\\n100% of the lifetime. When the metrics are calculated at 100% of the \\r\\nlifetime, we can observe that though visually the multivariate \\r\\npredictions appear superior, metrics like MAE and RMSE do not verify \\r\\nthis observation. This can be explained by looking at the overall trend of \\r\\nthe predicted RULs. The single feature observations demonstrate more \\r\\nsmooth and steady behaviors, while the multivariate RULs show a more \\r\\nerratic trend. Since the metrics measure the average error, it is reason\\r\\nable that the single feature estimations display better results since at the \\r\\nbeginning of the panels’ lifetimes, they remain close to the true RUL. \\r\\nHowever, near the EoL they are not able to converge as effectively and \\r\\nthis can be validated by the metrics calculated at 50% of the lifetime. \\r\\nWhen we observe the error metrics for 50% of the lifetime it can be seen \\r\\nthat the multivariate approach greatly outperforms the single feature \\r\\napproach by up to 55% (see MAPE). For this reason, we also propose a \\r\\nprognostic performance metric that gives more significance to pre\\r\\ndictions closer to the EoL. We denote this metric as weighted MAE \\r\\n(wMAE) and it is expressed by eq. (21). wi is a weight vector which gives \\r\\nhigher weight (and hence a larger penalty) to the error near the EoL. \\r\\nwMAE = 1\\r\\nN\\r\\n∑N\\r\\ni=1\\r\\n|\\r\\n(\\r\\nRULi − RULi\\r\\np\\r\\n)\\r\\nwi|\\r\\nwhere 0 ≤ wi ≤ 1 and ∑wi = 1\\r\\n(21) \\r\\nFor the metrics at 100% of the lifetime, unlike the MAE and the \\r\\nRMSE, MAPE for the single feature-based predictions is significantly \\r\\nhigher, which occurs since the metric measures the relative error to the \\r\\ntrue RUL. This can be also seen in the wMAE where the increased pen\\r\\nalty at the later stages of prediction has a significant negative effect on \\r\\nthe single feature estimations. In the case where the calculations are \\r\\nmade only for 50% of the lifetime, the multivariate approach out\\r\\nperforms almost every time, with an improvement of up to 55%. Though \\r\\ntraining the single feature BNN is much more efficient (170 s training \\r\\ntime) it is believed that the benefits to the performance of the multi\\r\\nvariate approach are significant. However, the single feature GPR re\\r\\nquires 5 s to train which is only a 1s improvement over the multivariate \\r\\nmodel. When comparing the performance of the two algorithms, we can \\r\\nsee that it is comparable with no algorithm significantly outperforming \\r\\nthe other, except for the training time. \\r\\nTable B1 \\r\\nExtracted Feature Names.

Conclusions \\r\\nWe present a methodology for RUL prediction of composite single\\x02stiffened panels subjected to fatigue compression loading based on AE \\r\\ndata. Two different fatigue loadings were applied, namely, constant \\r\\namplitude and variable amplitude. Acoustic emission sensors were \\r\\nemployed to monitor the panels’ degradation aiming towards an SHM \\r\\nframework for RUL prediction. To this end, several acoustic emission \\r\\nfeatures from the time and frequency domains were extracted and \\r\\nevaluated for their suitability to perform the RUL estimation task. The \\r\\ndiscovered features were visually inspected to select the 10 most \\r\\npromising to perform this task. Three common attributes were utilized \\r\\nto validate the selected features, i.e. monotonicity, prognosability and \\r\\ntrend. The selected features are normalized and smoothed to create \\r\\nsuitable Health Indicators to perform the RUL prognosis. \\r\\nFor the challenging task of RUL prognosis, two well established \\r\\nmachine learning algorithms were employed, Gaussian process regres\\r\\nsion and Artificial Neural Networks. Out of the 13 available degradation \\r\\nhistories 3 are selected at random to be used as a test set, while the \\r\\nremaining 10 are used to train the ML models and tune their parameters. \\r\\nThe RUL estimations of both models show good results managing to \\r\\nestimate the true RUL with great accuracy. However, though the pre\\r\\ndiction performance is comparable, training time for the GPR is signif\\r\\nicantly lower. The multivariate RUL estimations are then compared with \\r\\nthe prediction of the best feature (in terms of prognostic attributes), \\r\\nwhich showed good estimations, though at the EoL it failed to capture \\r\\nthe true RUL. The predictions were then evaluated with some common \\r\\nprognostic performance metrics from the literature. It was observed that \\r\\nthough visual inspection displayed the superior performance of the \\r\\nmultivariate method, some metrics did not depict that when calculated \\r\\nfor the entire lifetime, due to the smoother behavior the single feature \\r\\npredictions displayed. However, when looking only at prediction from \\r\\nthe middle up until the EoL, the multivariate approach significantly \\r\\noutperforms the single feature one with an improvement in metrics of up \\r\\nto 55%. This is happening because the multivariate approach is able to \\r\\nestimate the RUL close to the EoL much better. A new metric was also \\r\\nproposed, which gives more weight to the predictions closer to the EoL. \\r\\nThis weighted prognostic metric (weighted MAE) along with the metrics \\r\\ncalculated at 50% of the lifetime demonstrated the superiority of the \\r\\nmultivariate methodology which significantly outperformed the single\\x02feature methodology. \\r\\nThough, the challenges of employing AE in more complex structures \\r\\nare not addressed, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data-driven \\r\\nmethodology for this prognostic task. This methodology is not proposed \\r\\nas an in-situ framework for RUL estimation, however, due to the rela\\r\\ntively fast feature extraction (especially since only the discovered fea\\r\\ntures can be calculated) and algorithm training process (which can also \\r\\nbe done offline a priori) it can serve as a first step towards real-time \\r\\nmonitoring of composite structures. \\r\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement \\r\\nGeorgios Galanopoulos: Conceptualization, Methodology, Soft\\r\\nware, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft.
